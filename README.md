The student management system is a virtual demonstration of storage of student credentials such as student name, marks, branch, attendance and subjects.   
The Student Management System contains three main modules Admin, Faculty and  Principal.   

Admin can add Branches, Subjects and Students.  

Faculty has to update the marks and attendance of the Students.

The Application stores the data for a run time by implementing Arraylist, Hashset and HashMap.
